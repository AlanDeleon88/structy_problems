I have worked my way up from being a game tester to a junior developer in the software industry, providing me with an understanding of the software development process and the importance of quality assurance.

While at App Academy, I gained practical skills in full-stack web development using Python, React, Redux, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, and various tools and best practices such as Git and SCRUM.

I possess good attention to detail, the ability to learn quickly, and a get-things-done attitude, which I have demonstrated through completing a full-stack software engineering boot camp. My varied background in the service industry gives me a unique perspective and approach to development work.

As a mental health company, BetterHelp's mission to expand access to therapy aligns with my values. I am passionate about contributing to this mission by using my technical skills to develop and maintain high-quality products that meet users' needs.
